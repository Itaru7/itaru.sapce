        "text": "The Best intern ever had. He quickly understood the basic development policy and worked nicely with the other intern and me. He soon got used to our development environment and upgraded the OCR engine to the sufficient accuracy level by researching Tesseract 4 and pre-processing programs. Although it was challenging as a master or Ph.D. student tackles, he patiently and thoroughly worked on the task and found the solution with his resilience, which would be one of the essential qualifications of an engineer. I believe he is an OCR expert now. Also, Itaru coded a post-processing program to parse the text data to a JSON format flexibly adopting open-source codes from GitHub. Moreover, he proposed an improvement of the system during and after the employment period, which made me realize things that I cannot notice by myself. As a result of his great assistance, the development of the OCR engine largely advanced. I highly recommend you consider Itaru a strong candidate as a Python software engineer.",
